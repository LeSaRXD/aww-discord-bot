# Aww bot

This bot counts the number of times a user says awww

## Presets

presets work based on user ids

- {0} is the user id
- {1} is the aww count for the user
- {2} is the letter s if the count is greater than 1, else empty string

for the total preset, the only field {0} is total count for all users
